# Run, Furrest, Run!!

This game I made to learn the Unity engine.
It is made mostly like thosse mobile games where you have to run the fartest possible to earn points. You can change rails (or lanes) to avoid obstacles, but you character can only run forward and jump.
The idea is that Furrest, the cat, has played too much with his woolen balls, and have destroyed too many of them.

*Now it's their turn to revenge!*

You must try to go as far as possible and avoid crashing on the "bad" woolen balls (the orange things). Also, pick up milk and fishes, as they give you 100 points each!

If you crash 2 times or more, mother woolen ball will start running behind you, and if you crash again, it will be game over!


## Controls
The **UP** and **DOWN** arrows are used to **change lanes**
The **SPACE** key is used to **jump**.
